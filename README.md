# An abstract-ish documentation of my notebook from Summer 2024. 
I took photos of my notebook from my first semester of grad school, and displayed them as random diptychs. On the left is writing, and on the right is a drawing. 

I made this using JavaScript because I found it easier to do than using Premiere or After Effects or something like that.
